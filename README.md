## Backgound
Social media platforms are often used to convey personal feelings and opinions for the world to see. One of the biggest challenges       lies in understanding the "sentiments" behind social media posts.

Using Machine Learning we can analyze the sentiment behind texts or a post. It will allow organizations and corporations to             understand   consumer behaviour, which in turn, allow them to improve customer service and product enhancements. 

## Project Proposal
1) Using natural language processing (NLP) to systematically identify, extract, quantify and study affective states and subjective       information.
2) Allow user input to determine "keyword" for data set retrieval from twitter machine learning analysis
3) Use data visualization tools/skills to graphically display analysis results for simple visual representation of data
